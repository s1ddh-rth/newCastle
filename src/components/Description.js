                                        <p>Machine Learning can be multidimensional or different types of data. It can process and analyze these data that normal systems canâ€™t. Data is the most important part of any Machine Learning model. Also, studying and handling of data is a field in itself.</p>

                                        <p>Recently in China, a school has started to use ML to improve student focus. In online shopping, the ML model studies your searches. Based on your search history, it would provide advertisements. These will be about your search preferences in previous searches. In this, the search history is the data for the model. This is a great way to improve e-commerce with ML.</p>
